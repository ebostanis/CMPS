# CMPS
This group assignment was part of the course Computational Methods in Power Systems (ECE Auth - 9th Semester). The goal was to simulate different power systems and model transient phenomenons, faults and disturbances that occur on them. <br>
As a team we: <br>
  -Utilized NEPLAN & ATP-EMTP softwares for power system planning, load flow analysis, short circuit studies, stability assessments and protection coordination. <br>
  -Modeled electrical networks with lumped parameters and transmission lines with distributed parameters in the time-domain and frequency-dependent parameter models <br>
  -Predicted and analysed behavior of power lines, machines and generators under fault states, transient phenomena and atmospheric disturbances and calculated short circuit currents in three-phase ac systems according to IEC 60909 <br>

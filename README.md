# CMPS
This group assignment was part of the course Computational Methods in Power Systems (ECE Auth - 9th Semester). The goal was to simulate different power systems and model transient phenomenons, faults and disturbances that occur on them. The simulation of the assignment was done using the software EMTP-ATP.
